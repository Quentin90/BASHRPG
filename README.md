Basically it's a RPG Game turn per turn, where you'll fight monsters , find loots inside chests or go to the town to sell / buy items
You'll be able to level up to increase your stats and maybe later be able to cast spells , So far i still need to code the Town and the merchant and finally the spells.
And maybe adjust the game a little bit , i don't know yet if it's too hard or too easy but it can be very repetitiv.
All monster stats are generated randomly based on your stats.
